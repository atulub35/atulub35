## 👋 Hi, I’m **Atul Ubarhande**

I’m a **Frontend Engineer** with 8+ years of experience crafting modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications.  
I love building clean, efficient, and user-focused interfaces — and taking ownership from design to deployment.

My journey started with **HTML and CSS**, and over the years, I’ve grown into leading **frontend architecture**, mentoring teams, and delivering production-grade systems that balance **performance**, **usability**, and **developer experience**.

### 🚀 **What I Do**
- Design and implement **frontend architectures** that scale with product growth.  
- Build **reusable UI components** and design systems for consistency across products.  
- Lead migrations of legacy codebases to modern frameworks and build tools.  
- Collaborate closely with **designers**, **backend developers**, and **QA** for end-to-end delivery.  
- Continuously improve **user experience**, **web performance**, and **code maintainability**.
